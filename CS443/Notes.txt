1 Graph - the number of connections between 2 neuron is 1 - weight
2 Some neuron are specific in representing numbers - rate based
	1) Some neuron are specific in integer
	2) Some are specific in double
	3) All inputs should be considered as String, then converted to double
3 3 neorons for representing numbers - but only 2 numbers are used in the 1st version
4 No encoding neuron
5 1 comparing neuron which will also decode the message
6 Weight are written in the file

NOTE: The code is written in the MVC structure but there are differences between normal MVC and this one. 
It does not used distributed way.

Weight-file structure:
	#1 total number of neurons
	#2 - n weight
	
NOTE: LACK INPUT MECHANISM!!! NOW HARD CODING!!!
NOTE: WEIGHT NEEDS SYNCHRONIZATION
